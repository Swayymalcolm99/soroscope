# Liquidity Pool EmergencyGuard Operations

This liquidity pool contract includes EmergencyGuard-style controls for pausing
pool operations and managing the guard administrator set. The guard is designed
for emergency response without shutting down unrelated workflows.

## What The Guard Protects

The pool uses a compact `u32` pause bitmask. Each protected operation maps to a
single bit, so checking whether an operation is paused is constant time and only
requires reading one pause-state value.

| Operation | Flag | Bit | Protected entry point |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Swap | `pause_op::SWAP` | `1 << 0` | `swap` |
| Deposit | `pause_op::DEPOSIT` | `1 << 1` | `deposit` |
| Withdraw | `pause_op::WITHDRAW` | `1 << 2` | `withdraw` |
| Burn | `pause_op::BURN` | `1 << 5` | `burn` |
| All guard bits | `pause_op::ALL` | `u32::MAX` | Emergency pause and resume |

Granular pausing lets an admin stop the risky path while keeping safer paths
available. For example, swaps can be paused during a market incident while
withdrawals stay open.

## Initialization

Calling `initialize(admin, token_a, token_b)` bootstraps the guard with:

- `admin` as the first guard administrator.
- A multi-signature threshold of `1`.
- A pause state of `0`, meaning no operations are paused.

The guard state is stored in instance storage:

- `GuardAdmins`: `Vec<Address>`
- `GuardThreshold`: `u32`
- `GuardPauseState`: `u32`

## Granular Pause API

Use the dedicated helper functions for the common pool controls:

```rust
// Pause or resume only swaps.
pool.pause_swaps();
pool.resume_swaps();

// Pause or resume only deposits.
pool.pause_deposits();
pool.resume_deposits();

// Pause or resume only withdrawals.
pool.pause_withdrawals();
pool.resume_withdrawals();

// Pause or resume the core guarded operations at once.
pool.set_paused(true);
pool.set_paused(false);
```

For read-only inspection:

```rust
let state: u32 = pool.get_pause_state();
let swaps_paused: bool = pool.is_paused_op(pause_op::SWAP);
let deposits_paused: bool = pool.is_paused_op(pause_op::DEPOSIT);
```

## Multi-Sig Admin Operations

Critical guard changes receive an `approvers: Vec<Address>` argument. The
contract checks unique approvers, confirms they are current guard admins, and
calls `require_auth()` on each counted approver. The operation succeeds when the
number of valid approvers is at least `GuardThreshold`.

With the default threshold of `1`, one current guard admin can approve:

```rust
let approvers = vec![&env, admin.clone()];

pool.emergency_pause_all(approvers.clone());
pool.resume_all(approvers.clone());
pool.add_guard_admin(approvers.clone(), new_admin.clone());
pool.remove_guard_admin(approvers, old_admin.clone());
```

Duplicate approver addresses do not increase the approval count. Removing an
admin is rejected when it would reduce the admin count below the current
threshold.

## Emergency Workflows

### Pause swaps only

Use this when price discovery, oracle input, or routing behavior is suspect but
liquidity exits should remain available.

```rust
pool.pause_swaps();

assert!(pool.is_paused_op(pause_op::SWAP));
assert!(!pool.is_paused_op(pause_op::WITHDRAW));
```

### Pause deposits only

Use this when new liquidity should be halted while the pool is being reviewed.

```rust
pool.pause_deposits();

assert!(pool.is_paused_op(pause_op::DEPOSIT));
assert!(!pool.is_paused_op(pause_op::SWAP));
```

### Full emergency pause

Use this when the safest response is to block every guarded operation.

```rust
let approvers = vec![&env, admin.clone()];

pool.emergency_pause_all(approvers);

assert!(pool.is_paused_op(pause_op::SWAP));
assert!(pool.is_paused_op(pause_op::DEPOSIT));
assert!(pool.is_paused_op(pause_op::WITHDRAW));
assert!(pool.is_paused_op(pause_op::BURN));
```

### Resume after remediation

Only resume after the incident has been investigated and the same approval model
has authorized the recovery.

```rust
let approvers = vec![&env, admin.clone()];

pool.resume_all(approvers);
assert_eq!(pool.get_pause_state(), 0);
```

## Admin Management

The guard administrator set can be inspected and changed through the pool API.

```rust
let admins = pool.get_guard_admins();
let threshold = pool.get_guard_threshold();

let approvers = vec![&env, admin.clone()];
pool.add_guard_admin(approvers.clone(), new_admin.clone());
pool.remove_guard_admin(approvers, retired_admin.clone());
```

Recommended operating model:

- Keep at least two guard admins for production deployments.
- Use a threshold that matches the incident response policy.
- Rotate or remove compromised admins before resuming paused operations.
- Keep an off-chain runbook that maps each admin address to an operator.

## Error Handling

Guarded calls return the pool's `Error` enum:

- `Error::Paused`: the requested operation is currently paused.
- `Error::Unauthorized`: the caller or approver set is not authorized.
- `Error::NotInitialized`: guard state has not been initialized.

Callers should treat `Error::Paused` as an expected operational state, not as a
contract failure. The pause can be cleared by an authorized guard admin workflow.

## Design Notes

The guard path is intentionally lean:

- Pause checks are `O(1)` bit tests against a single `u32`.
- Pause state uses one compact instance-storage value.
- Admin and approver validation is linear in the number of supplied addresses,
  which is appropriate because admin lists are expected to be small.
- Public helper functions avoid forcing callers to construct bitmasks for common
  actions such as pausing swaps or deposits.
